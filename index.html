            <p class="boxContainer" style="color:#4f4f4f" class="textFont">Skin is held tight and smooth by three critical components: collagen, hyaluronic acid, and elastin. These chemicals combine to create a firm, spongy meshwork under the skin surface. This elastic structure keeps the skin surface smooth and firm. With age, this meshwork slowly loses its integrity. With weakness in the underlying support structure, the skin's surface loses its perfect baby-skin smoothness. Injecting cosmetic fillers helps fill the thinned-out meshwork. The fillers plump up the tissue underneath the skin, shrinking wrinkles. The skin becomes firmer, smoother, and younger-looking. Collagen is the oldest and best-known cosmetic filler. Newer natural and synthetic products are available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>

              <p class="textFont">Retox-A may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening. Call your doctor or get medical help right away if you have any of these problems any time (hours to weeks) after injection of Retox-A:

            <p class="textFont">
            1. Problems swallowing, speaking, or breathing, due to weakening of associated muscles, can be severe and result in loss of life. You are at the highest risk if these problems are pre-existing before injection. Swallowing problems may last for several months
            </p>
            <p class="textFont">
            2. Spread of toxin effects. The effect of botulinum toxin may affect areas away from the injection site and cause serious symptoms including: loss of strength and all-over muscle weakness, double vision, blurred vision and drooping eyelids, hoarseness or change or loss of voice (dysphonia), trouble saying words clearly (dysarthria), loss of bladder control, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing. If this happens, do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities.
            </p>

            The dose of Retox-A is not the same as, or comparable to, another botulinum toxin product.
            </p>
              <p class="textFont">There has not been a confirmed serious case of spread of toxin effect when Retox-A has been used at the recommended dose to treat frown lines.</p>

            <div id="thirdModal" class="reveal-modal" data-reveal>
              <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
              <p>What is Retox-A?</p>
<p>Retox-A is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used to improve the look of moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines) in people 18 to 65 years of age for a short period of time (temporary).</p>

<p>Retox-A is administered by a healthcare professional as a simple, nonsurgical treatment that is injected directly into the muscles between the brows. It works by blocking nerve impulses to the injected muscles. This reduces muscle activity that causes moderate to severe lines to form between the brows. Individual results may vary.</p>


<p>How does Retox-A work?</p>
<p>Retox-A is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used to improve the look of the “11s,” the moderate-to-severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines). It works by blocking nerve impulses to the injected muscles. This reduces muscle activity that causes moderate to severe lines to form between the brows.</p>


<p>When will I see results from a Retox-A treatment?</p>
<p>Within days, you may see a marked improvement in the moderate-to-severe frown lines between your brows. Lines continue to improve for up to 30 days, and results can last for up to 4 months. Individual results may vary.</p>


<p>How long does Retox-A last?</p>
<p>Visible results have been shown to last up to 4 months.1 Your own results may vary – be sure to talk to your healthcare provider about what you can expect and when to schedule your next appointment.</p>

<p>Is treatment with Retox-A painful?</p>
<p>Discomfort is usually minimal and brief. Prior to injection, your physician may choose to numb the area with a cold pack or anesthetic cream. The entire procedure takes approximately 10 minutes. Most patients are in and out of the physician’s office without downtime following Retox-A Cosmetic treatment.
Side effects associated with the injection include localized pain, infection, inflammation, tenderness, swelling, swelling, redness, and/or bleeding/bruising.</p>

<p>Will I still be able to make facial expressions?</p>
<p>Although the results are visible, a treatment with Retox-A (onabotulinumtoxinA) will not radically change your facial appearance or make you look as if you’ve “had work done.” The muscle activity that causes frown lines between the brows is temporarily reduced, so you can still frown or look surprised without the wrinkles and creases between your brows.

                <p>Cosmetic Retox-A when injected underneath the skin make it fuller. After an injection, the plumper skin shows fewer wrinkles and looks younger. Injectable products have been around for decades. In recent years, medical advances have brought new versions of this wrinkle treatment to the marketplace. Newer Retox-A it last longer, even permanent. But be sure to do your homework before heading to the cosmetic specilist.</p>

              <div class="content" id="panel2" >
                <p>Aging skin and wrinkles result from a combination of many factors. It’s not just about cellular changes, collagen depletion, hormone loss, or damage caused by free radicals. The 11s – those vertical lines that appear between your brows – result from muscle contractions. When you concentrate, squint, or frown, the muscles between your brows contract, causing your skin to furrow and fold. After years of frequent contraction, those wrinkles can linger even after the muscles are at rest.</p>

                      <p>Retox-A works by blocking nerve impulses to the injected muscles. This reduces muscle activity that causes the persistent lines to form between the brows.</p>

              <div class="content" id="panel3" >
                <p>Retox-A is certainly not just for women. If you are a man and think it's time to do something about those moderate to severe glabellar lines between your brows, talk to your doctor about whether Retox-A is right for you.</p>
